        <h1>Privacy Notice</h1>
        <p><em>Last updated: [Insert date]</em></p>

        <p>
          The National Petroleum Council (“NPC”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) is committed to
          handling information about visitors to this website in a responsible manner.
          This Privacy Notice explains, in brief, what we collect, how we use it, and
          your choices.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect limited information in two ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Information you provide</strong> – for example, when you contact us
            by email or through a form, you may provide your name, organization, email
            address, or other details.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Information collected automatically</strong> – when you visit our
            site, we collect technical information such as your IP address, browser and
            device type, pages visited, links clicked, and the date and time of your
            visit.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Use of Google Analytics</h2>
        <p>
          We use Google Analytics to help us understand how visitors use this site and
          to improve our content and usability. Google Analytics uses cookies and
          similar technologies to collect information such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Which pages are visited and for how long</li>
          <li>Links and downloads that are clicked</li>
          <li>Approximate geographic region, browser, and device type</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This information is processed in aggregate and is not used by us to identify
          individual users. Google may process this data on servers located in the
          United States and may use it in accordance with its own privacy policies.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can control or disable Google Analytics cookies through your browser
          settings. You may also use browser add-ons or tools that block analytics
          tracking if you prefer.
        </p>

        <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Monitor site performance and security</li>
          <li>Understand how visitors access and use our reports and materials</li>
          <li>Respond to inquiries you choose to send to us</li>
          <li>Prepare non-identifiable usage statistics for internal reporting</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We do <strong>not</strong> use this website to serve advertising, create
          marketing profiles, or sell personal information.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Sharing and Retention</h2>
        <p>
          We may share aggregated, non-identifiable usage statistics with government
          partners, contractors, or working groups who assist us in operating this site
          or evaluating its reach. We do not sell or rent personal information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Web logs and analytics data are retained only as long as necessary for
          security, operational, and reporting purposes, and are then deleted or
          anonymized where feasible.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Security</h2>
        <p>
          We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information
          collected through this website. However, no internet-based system can be
          guaranteed to be completely secure.
        </p>

        <h2>6. External Links</h2>
        <p>
          Our site may contain links to third-party websites, including government
          agencies, research organizations, and other external resources. We are not
          responsible for the content or privacy practices of those sites and encourage
          you to review their privacy statements separately.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Notice</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time. Any changes will be
          posted on this page with an updated “Last updated” date.
